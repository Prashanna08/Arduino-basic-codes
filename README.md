# Arduino-basic-codes
A repository consisting of basic to intermediate Arduino codes

The programs can be copy pasted into an Arduino IDE and once the correct Arduino Board version is selected along with the Com port and Bootloader the program can be uploaded into the hardware.

Libraries used in some of the programs may require separate installation of the necessary library files, which can be downloaded from inside the Arduino IDE -> Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraies and downloaded by searching with its name

Sensors and actuators can be used as per requirements of the program

Happy coding!
